I live in Queens and attend Townsend Harris High School.

I also have two sisters which I do many activities with.

One of our favorite hobbies is dancing.

<h1>Sanasani Dancers</h1>

<p style="color:red;text-align:center;"> For the past two years the Sanasani members have been taking part in both the Queens and Mahattan LGBTQ parades. We practice for several months working together to pick songs and come up with choregraphies to wow the present audience and also the viewers watching from home on TV.<p>

<img src= "beachcleanup.JPG" alt "beachcleanup" style= "width:400;height:300;">

<p style="color:blue;text-align:center;"> Every month, along with the Sadhana Coalition of Progressive Hindus Foundation, Sanasani takes up the opportunity to go out and clean up the garbage left out on the Jamaica Bay. It is a great experience for both the children and their parents to volunteer to help preserve and keep our planet clean<p>

As a result of their achievement they were also featured on vogue magazine for their exquisite outfit stylings.<p>
